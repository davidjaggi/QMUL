abstract = {We exploit ideas from high-dimensional data analysis to derive new portmanteau tests that are based on the trace of the square of the mth order autocorrelation matrix. The resulting statistics are weighted sums of the squares of the sample autocorrelation coefficients that, unlike many other tests appearing in the literature, are numerically stable even when the number of lags considered is relatively close to the sample size. The statistics behave asymptotically as a linear combination of chi-squared random variables and their asymptotic distribution can be approximated by a gamma distribution. The proposed tests are modified to check for nonlinearity and to check the adequacy of a fitted nonlinear model. Simulation evidence indicates that the proposed goodness of fit tests tend to have higher power than other tests appearing in the literature, particularly in detecting long-memory nonlinear models. The efficacy of the proposed methods is demonstrated by investigating nonlinear effects in Apple, Inc., and Nikkei-300 daily returns during the 2006–2007 calendar years.

abstract = {This paper studies seven GARCH models, including RiskMetrics and two long memory GARCH models, in Value at Risk (VaR) estimation. Both long and short positions of investment were considered. The seven models were applied to 12 market indices and four foreign exchange rates to assess each model in estimating VaR at various confidence levels. The results indicate that both stationary and fractionally integrated GARCH models outperform RiskMetrics in estimating 1{\%} VaR. Although most return series show fat-tailed distribution and satisfy the long memory property, it is more important to consider a model with fat-tailed error in estimating VaR. Asymmetric behavior is also discovered in the stock market data that t-error models give better 1{\%} VaR estimates than normal-error models in long position, but not in short position. No such asymmetry is observed in the exchange rate data. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To a substantial degree, the negative elasticity of variance with respect to value of equity that is part of market folklore is found to be attributable to financial leverage. A maximum likehood estimator is developed for this elasticity that is substantially more efficient than extant estimation procedures. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

The family of distributions considered is the generalized t (GT), which includes the power exponential or Box-Tiao, normal, Laplace, and t distributions as special cases. The corresponding influence function is bounded and redescending for finite “degrees of freedom.” The regression estimators considered are those that maximize the GT quasi-likelihood, as well as one-step versions. Estimators of the parameters of the GT distribution and the effect of such estimates on the asymptotic efficiency of the regression estimates are discussed.

@article{Nyblom1989,
abstract = {Tests are proposed for detecting possible changes in parameters when the observations are obtained sequentially in time. While deriving the tests the alternative one has in mind specifies the parameter process as a martingale. The distribution theory of these tests relies on the large-sample results; that is, only the limiting null distributions are known (except in very special cases). The main tool in establishing these limiting distributions is weak convergence of stochastic processes. Suppose that we have vector-valued observations x1,...,xn obtained sequentially in time (or ordered in some other linear fashion). Their joint distribution is described by determining the initial distribution for x1 and the conditional distribution for each xk given the past up to xk - 1. Suppose further that these distributions depend on a p-dimensional parameter vector $\theta$. At least locally (i.e., in a short time period) this may be more or less legitimate. In the long run, however, the possibility of some changes in the observation-generating process should be taken into account. Specifically, it is assumed here that those changes occur through a parameter variation in the form of a martingale. The martingale specification has an advantage of covering several types of departure of constancy: for example, a single jump at an unknown time point (the so-called change-point model) or slow random variation (typically random walk). The tests are derived by first finding the locally most powerful test against a martingale-type alternative when the starting value of the parameter process is known. After some simplification a test having a known numerically tractable limiting distribution is developed. When the starting point is unknown an efficient estimate is substituted for it. In addition, the corresponding limiting distribution is established. The proposed tests turn out to be based on cumulative sums of the score function (the derivative of the log-likelihood).},

If attention is restricted to one forecasting method for all frequencies, the most consistent forecasting performance is provided by moving average and GARCH models.

abstract = {There is now substantial evidence that daily equity returns are not normally distributed but instead display significant leptokurtosis and, in many cases, skewness. Considerable effort has been made in order to capture these empirical characteristics using a range of ad hoc statistical distributions. In this paper, we investigate the distribution of daily, weekly and monthly equity returns in the UK and US using two very flexible families of distributions that have been recently introduced: the exponential generalised beta (EGB) and the skewed generalised- t (SGT). These distributions permit very diverse levels of skewness and kurtosis and, between them, nest many of the distributions previously considered in the literature. Both the EGB and the SGT provide a very substantial improvement over the normal distribution in both markets. Moreover, for daily returns, we strongly reject the restrictions on the EGB and SGT implied by most of the distributions that are commonly used for modelling equity returns, including the student- t , the power exponential and the logistic distributions. Instead, our preferred distributions for daily returns are the generalised- t for the US and the skewed- t for the UK, both of which are members of the SGT family. For weekly returns, our preferred distributions are the student- t for the UK and the skewed- t for the US, while for monthly returns, our preferred distributions are the EBR12 for the UK and the logistic for the US.

These models, however, have at least three major drawbacks in asset pricing applications: (i) Researchers beginning with Black (1976) have found a negative correlation between current returns and future returns volatility. GARCH models rule this out by assumption. (ii) GARCH models impose parameter restrictions that are often violated by estimated coefficients and that may unduly restrict the dynamics of the conditional variance process. (iii) Interpreting whether shocks to conditional variance "persist" or not is difficult in GARCH models, because the usual norms measuring persistence often do not agree. A new form of ARCH is proposed that meets these objections. The method is used to estimate a model of the risk premium on the CRSP Value-Weighted Market Index from 1962 to 1987.},

abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

For the case of nested models, this is accomplished via the out of sample encompassing tests of [Clark, T.E., {\&} McCracken, M.W., 2001. Tests for equal forecast accuracy and encompassing for nested models. Journal of Econometrics, 105, 85-110.].

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews modeling time-varying volatility using generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) processes. The presence of excess kurtosis in GARCH models with conditional normally distributed innovations has led to the use of student-GARCH models and GARCH-jump models. Persistence in conditional variances was modeled using variance component models with a stochastic trend component. The finding of time-variation in conditional covariances and correlations resulted in the development of multivariate GARCH and factor-GARCH models. Factor-GARCH models have several attractive features. First, they can be easily interpreted in terms of economic theory (factor models like the arbitrage pricing theory have been used extensively in finance). Second, they allow for a parsimonious representation of time-varying variances and covariances for a high dimensional vector of variables. Third, they can account for both observed and unobserved factors. Fourth, they have interesting implications for common features of the variables. These common features can be tested in a straightforward way. Fifth, they have appeared to fit well in several instances.},

abstract = {A 'long memory' property of stock market returns is investigated in this paper. It is found that not only there is substantially more correlation between absolute returns than returns them-selves, but the power transformation of the absolute return lrfl " also has quite high autocorrel-ation for long lags. It is possible to characterize lrfld to be 'long memory' and this property is strongest when d is around 1. This result appears to argue against ARCH type specifications based upon squared returns. But our Monte-Carlo study shows that both ARCH type models based on squared returns and those based on absolute return can produce this property. A new general class of models is proposed which allows the power 6 of the heteroskedasticity equation to be estimated from the data.},

@article{Dziak2012,
abstract = {Choosing a model with too few parameters can involve making unreal- istically simple assumptions and lead to high bias, poor prediction, and missed opportunities for insight. Such models are not flexible enough to describe the sample or the population well. A model with too many parameters can fit the observed data very well, but be too closely tai- lored to it. Such models may generalize poorly. Penalized-likelihood information criteria, such as Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the Consistent AIC, and the Adjusted BIC, are widely used for model selection. However, differ- ent criteria sometimes support different models, leading to uncertainty about which criterion is the most trustworthy. In some simple cases the comparison of two models using information criteria can be viewed as equivalent to a likelihood ratio test, with the different models repre- senting different alpha levels (i.e., different emphases on sensitivity or specificity; Lin {\&} Dayton 1997). This perspective may lead to insights about how to interpret the criteria in less simple situations. For ex- ample, AIC or BIC could be preferable, depending on sample size and on the relative importance one assigns to sensitivity versus specificity. Understanding the differences among the criteria may make it easier to compare their results and to use them to make informed decisions.},

@article{Henry1998,
abstract = {Recent studies suggest that a negative shock to stock prices will generate more volatility than a positive shock of equal magnitude. This paper uses daily data from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to illustrate the nature of stock market volatility. Regression-based tests for integration in variance are applied, providing contrasting results to the usual test based on the Wald statistic. A partially non-parametric model of the relationship between news and volatility is estimated and used in conjunction with tests for the sensitivity to both the size and sign of a shock as a metric to judge various candidate characterizations of the underlying data generating process. I. INTRODUCTI ON There appears to be widespread agreement that the vola-tility of asset returns is, to a degree, forecastable. Recently, a great deal of attention has been focused on this topic, see Bollerslev et al. (1992, 1994) for detailed surveys. Theory suggests that the price of an asset is a function of the volatility, or risk, of the asset. Consequently, an understand-ing of how volatility evolves over time is central to the decision making process. Moreover, optimal inference about the conditional mean of a variable requires that the conditional second moment be correctly specified. Misspeci-fied models of stock volatility may lead to incorrect, or invalid, conclusions about stock return dynamics. Black (1976), Christie (1982), Nelson (1991), Pagan and Schwert (1990), Sentena (1992), Campbell and Hentschel (1992) and Engle and Ng (1993) all report evidence that suggests that a negative shock to stock returns will generate more volatility than a positive shock of equal magnitude. Black and Christie suggest that as stock prices fall, the weight attached to debt in the capital structure increases. This increase in leverage will lead equity holders, who bear the residual risk of the firm, to anticipate higher expected future returns volatility. Both authors find that their predic-tions are satisfied for data on individual stock returns. However, there remains no general agreement as to how the predictability of volatility should be modelled and, in particular, how to condition such models for the asymme-tric nature of stock return volatility. In Section II of this paper various models of stock return volatility, both sym-metric and asymmetric are outlined. Section III describes the data. Section IV discusses the estimation and testing procedure and presents initial empirical results. Section V presents the partially non-parametric model of stock return volatility, and estimates of the relationship between news and volatility for each of the candidate models. The final section provides a brief summary and conclusion.},

The moving average (MA) part accounts for mean reversion required for the rates to stay inside the target zone. The generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) part accounts for changing volatility, whereas the jump process models parity changes and other erratic movements. Using an adjusted Pearson chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, we find similar results for the Bernoulli and the Poisson jump processes. In those cases in which the Bernoulli-normal distribution does not pass the goodness-of-fit test, a mixture of three normals does. Finally the MA(1)-GARCH(1, 1)-Bernoulli jump models are jointly estimated assuming a constant contemporaneous correlation matrix for the disturbances and a common jump probability for all the currencies.},
