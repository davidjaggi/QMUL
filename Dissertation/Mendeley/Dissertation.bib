abstract = {Weekly rates of the European Monetary System (EMS) vis-{\`{a}}-vis the Deutsche mark from April 1979 to March 1991 are modeled as a combined MA (1)-GARCH(1, 1)-jump process. The moving average (MA) part accounts for mean reversion required for the rates to stay inside the target zone. The generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) part accounts for changing volatility, whereas the jump process models parity changes and other erratic movements. Using an adjusted Pearson chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, we find similar results for the Bernoulli and the Poisson jump processes. In those cases in which the Bernoulli-normal distribution does not pass the goodness-of-fit test, a mixture of three normals does. Finally the MA(1)-GARCH(1, 1)-Bernoulli jump models are jointly estimated assuming a constant contemporaneous correlation matrix for the disturbances and a common jump probability for all the currencies.},

We motivate our study with analytical results on the distortions caused by some widely used loss functions, when used with standard volatility proxies such as squared returns, the intra-daily range or realised volatility. We then derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the functional form of the loss function for the ranking of competing volatility forecasts to be robust to the presence of noise in the volatility proxy, and derive some useful special cases of this class of ''robust'' loss functions. The methods are illustrated with an application to the volatility of returns on IBM over the period 1993 to 2003.},

@article{Nyblom1989,
abstract = {Tests are proposed for detecting possible changes in parameters when the observations are obtained sequentially in time. While deriving the tests the alternative one has in mind specifies the parameter process as a martingale. The distribution theory of these tests relies on the large-sample results; that is, only the limiting null distributions are known (except in very special cases). The main tool in establishing these limiting distributions is weak convergence of stochastic processes. Suppose that we have vector-valued observations x1,...,xn obtained sequentially in time (or ordered in some other linear fashion). Their joint distribution is described by determining the initial distribution for x1 and the conditional distribution for each xk given the past up to xk - 1. Suppose further that these distributions depend on a p-dimensional parameter vector $\theta$. At least locally (i.e., in a short time period) this may be more or less legitimate. In the long run, however, the possibility of some changes in the observation-generating process should be taken into account. Specifically, it is assumed here that those changes occur through a parameter variation in the form of a martingale. The martingale specification has an advantage of covering several types of departure of constancy: for example, a single jump at an unknown time point (the so-called change-point model) or slow random variation (typically random walk). The tests are derived by first finding the locally most powerful test against a martingale-type alternative when the starting value of the parameter process is known. After some simplification a test having a known numerically tractable limiting distribution is developed. When the starting point is unknown an efficient estimate is substituted for it. In addition, the corresponding limiting distribution is established. The proposed tests turn out to be based on cumulative sums of the score function (the derivative of the log-likelihood).},

@article{Henry1998,
abstract = {Recent studies suggest that a negative shock to stock prices will generate more volatility than a positive shock of equal magnitude. This paper uses daily data from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to illustrate the nature of stock market volatility. Regression-based tests for integration in variance are applied, providing contrasting results to the usual test based on the Wald statistic. A partially non-parametric model of the relationship between news and volatility is estimated and used in conjunction with tests for the sensitivity to both the size and sign of a shock as a metric to judge various candidate characterizations of the underlying data generating process. I. INTRODUCTI ON There appears to be widespread agreement that the vola-tility of asset returns is, to a degree, forecastable. Recently, a great deal of attention has been focused on this topic, see Bollerslev et al. (1992, 1994) for detailed surveys. Theory suggests that the price of an asset is a function of the volatility, or risk, of the asset. Consequently, an understand-ing of how volatility evolves over time is central to the decision making process. Moreover, optimal inference about the conditional mean of a variable requires that the conditional second moment be correctly specified. Misspeci-fied models of stock volatility may lead to incorrect, or invalid, conclusions about stock return dynamics. Black (1976), Christie (1982), Nelson (1991), Pagan and Schwert (1990), Sentena (1992), Campbell and Hentschel (1992) and Engle and Ng (1993) all report evidence that suggests that a negative shock to stock returns will generate more volatility than a positive shock of equal magnitude. Black and Christie suggest that as stock prices fall, the weight attached to debt in the capital structure increases. This increase in leverage will lead equity holders, who bear the residual risk of the firm, to anticipate higher expected future returns volatility. Both authors find that their predic-tions are satisfied for data on individual stock returns. However, there remains no general agreement as to how the predictability of volatility should be modelled and, in particular, how to condition such models for the asymme-tric nature of stock return volatility. In Section II of this paper various models of stock return volatility, both sym-metric and asymmetric are outlined. Section III describes the data. Section IV discusses the estimation and testing procedure and presents initial empirical results. Section V presents the partially non-parametric model of stock return volatility, and estimates of the relationship between news and volatility for each of the candidate models. The final section provides a brief summary and conclusion.},

Both long and short positions of investment were considered. The seven models were applied to 12 market indices and four foreign exchange rates to assess each model in estimating VaR at various confidence levels. The results indicate that both stationary and fractionally integrated GARCH models outperform RiskMetrics in estimating 1{\%} VaR. Although most return series show fat-tailed distribution and satisfy the long memory property, it is more important to consider a model with fat-tailed error in estimating VaR. Asymmetric behavior is also discovered in the stock market data that t-error models give better 1{\%} VaR estimates than normal-error models in long position, but not in short position. No such asymmetry is observed in the exchange rate data. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {GARCH models have been applied in modelling the relation between conditional variance and asset risk premia. These models, however, have at least three major drawbacks in asset pricing applications: (i) Researchers beginning with Black (1976) have found a negative correlation between current returns and future returns volatility. GARCH models rule this out by assumption. (ii) GARCH models impose parameter restrictions that are often violated by estimated coefficients and that may unduly restrict the dynamics of the conditional variance process. (iii) Interpreting whether shocks to conditional variance "persist" or not is difficult in GARCH models, because the usual norms measuring persistence often do not agree. A new form of ARCH is proposed that meets these objections. The method is used to estimate a model of the risk premium on the CRSP Value-Weighted Market Index from 1962 to 1987.},

abstract = {A 'long memory' property of stock market returns is investigated in this paper. It is found that not only there is substantially more correlation between absolute returns than returns them-selves, but the power transformation of the absolute return lrfl " also has quite high autocorrel-ation for long lags. It is possible to characterize lrfld to be 'long memory' and this property is strongest when d is around 1. This result appears to argue against ARCH type specifications based upon squared returns. But our Monte-Carlo study shows that both ARCH type models based on squared returns and those based on absolute return can produce this property. A new general class of models is proposed which allows the power 6 of the heteroskedasticity equation to be estimated from the data.},

We motivate our study with analytical results on the distortions caused by some widely-used loss functions, when used with stan-dard volatility proxies such as squared returns, the intra-daily range or realised volatility. We then derive necessary and su¢ cient conditions on the functional form of the loss function for the ranking of competing volatility forecasts to be robust to the presence of noise in the volatility proxy, and derive some useful special cases of this class of " robust " loss functions. The methods are illustrated with an application to the volatility of returns on IBM over the period 1993 to 2003.},

@article{Engle1982,
abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

For individual stocks, this correlation is moderate and decays exponentially over 50 days, while for stock indices, it is much stronger but decays faster. For individual stocks, the magnitude of this correlation has a universal value that can be rationalized in terms of a new `retarded' model which interpolates between a purely additive and a purely multiplicative stochastic process. For stock indices a specific market panic phenomenon seems to be necessary to account for the observed amplitude of the effect.},

Test assets include a range of domestic and international equity indices and exchange rates. We find that model rankings are insensitive to the forecast horizon and suggestions for best practices emerge. While our main sample spans from 1990 to 2008, we take advantage of the near-record surge in volatility during the last half of 2008 to ask whether forecasting models or best practices break down during periods of turmoil. Sur-prisingly, we find that volatility during the 2008 crisis was well approximated by predictions made one day ahead, and should have been within risk managers'1{\%} confidence intervals up to one month ahead.},
