abstract = {In this paper we consider a modification of the classical ARCH models introduced by Engle (1982). In this modified model the conditional standard deviation is a piecewise linear function of past values of the white noise. This specific form allows different reactions of the volatility to different signs of the lagged errors. Stationarity conditions are derived. Maximum likelihood and least squares estimation are also considered. Finally an empirical example relating to the French CAC stock index is presented and several specifications are compared.},

Parametric Lagrange multiplier (LM) or LM type tests of no ARCH in standardized errors, linearity, and parameter constancy are proposed. The asymptotic null distributions of the tests are standard, which makes application easy. Versions of the tests that are robust against nonnormal errors are provided. The {\"{y}}nite sample properties of the test statistics are investigated by simulation. The robust tests prove superior to the nonrobust ones when the errors are non-normal.

@article{Engle1982,
abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

These models, however, have at least three major drawbacks in asset pricing applications: (i) Researchers beginning with Black (1976) have found a negative correlation between current returns and future returns volatility. GARCH models rule this out by assumption. (ii) GARCH models impose parameter restrictions that are often violated by estimated coefficients and that may unduly restrict the dynamics of the conditional variance process. (iii) Interpreting whether shocks to conditional variance "persist" or not is difficult in GARCH models, because the usual norms measuring persistence often do not agree. A new form of ARCH is proposed that meets these objections. The method is used to estimate a model of the risk premium on the CRSP Value-Weighted Market Index from 1962 to 1987.},

@article{Henry1998,
abstract = {Recent studies suggest that a negative shock to stock prices will generate more volatility than a positive shock of equal magnitude. This paper uses daily data from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to illustrate the nature of stock market volatility. Regression-based tests for integration in variance are applied, providing contrasting results to the usual test based on the Wald statistic. A partially non-parametric model of the relationship between news and volatility is estimated and used in conjunction with tests for the sensitivity to both the size and sign of a shock as a metric to judge various candidate characterizations of the underlying data generating process. I. INTRODUCTI ON There appears to be widespread agreement that the vola-tility of asset returns is, to a degree, forecastable. Recently, a great deal of attention has been focused on this topic, see Bollerslev et al. (1992, 1994) for detailed surveys. Theory suggests that the price of an asset is a function of the volatility, or risk, of the asset. Consequently, an understand-ing of how volatility evolves over time is central to the decision making process. Moreover, optimal inference about the conditional mean of a variable requires that the conditional second moment be correctly specified. Misspeci-fied models of stock volatility may lead to incorrect, or invalid, conclusions about stock return dynamics. Black (1976), Christie (1982), Nelson (1991), Pagan and Schwert (1990), Sentena (1992), Campbell and Hentschel (1992) and Engle and Ng (1993) all report evidence that suggests that a negative shock to stock returns will generate more volatility than a positive shock of equal magnitude. Black and Christie suggest that as stock prices fall, the weight attached to debt in the capital structure increases. This increase in leverage will lead equity holders, who bear the residual risk of the firm, to anticipate higher expected future returns volatility. Both authors find that their predic-tions are satisfied for data on individual stock returns. However, there remains no general agreement as to how the predictability of volatility should be modelled and, in particular, how to condition such models for the asymme-tric nature of stock return volatility. In Section II of this paper various models of stock return volatility, both sym-metric and asymmetric are outlined. Section III describes the data. Section IV discusses the estimation and testing procedure and presents initial empirical results. Section V presents the partially non-parametric model of stock return volatility, and estimates of the relationship between news and volatility for each of the candidate models. The final section provides a brief summary and conclusion.},
